You can download the apk to preview.http://www.coolapk.com/apk/com.seki.noteasklite

All code including a rich-text-editor module written by my friend can be used by anyone for free.Although the architecture of the project may seem a bit outdated at the present,I still hope you can make some pull requests and fork it.
